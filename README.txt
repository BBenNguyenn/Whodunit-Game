Completed April 2019
Small academic project, my first Ruby project.
Guess Who inspired "Whodunit"
Play against AI which narrows down its choices.

RUN WITH:
    $ ruby Main.rb


PLEASE NOTE:

    - I have included a printing for the case where one player is left standing
        i.e. they automatically win. (can be tested with 1 AI player and purposefully losing)

    - The interactive player ID is the last index,
        i.e. the number that was inputted as number of computer opponents
        i.e. player 0 is the first AI player, if input was 3, then you are Player 3

    - I'm sorry if the play method is a mess, I was trying to emulate the logic
      somewhat verbosely and did not think it should be complicated with helper methods.
